# Roadmap

- [x] Expand tilde and globs in source paths
- [x] Add ignore patterns to LocalSyncConfig
- [x] Add [global] section to config file, which defines global settings like
      staging directory, and default behaviours like whether to
      `copy`/`symlink` when syncing.
- [ ] Implement staging when `global.method` is `symlink`
